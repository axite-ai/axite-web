AI agents are transforming how businesses operate. But as these autonomous systems take on more critical tasks, a fundamental question emerges: how do you maintain control without sacrificing the benefits of automation?

## The Agent Control Problem

Modern AI agents can read documents, execute code, send emails, and interact with external APIs. This power comes with risk. Without proper governance, agents can:

- Access data they should not see
- Take actions that violate compliance requirements
- Make decisions without proper oversight
- Leave no audit trail for security reviews

## Axite: Your Agent Governance Control Plane

Axite sits between your agents and the actions they want to take. Think of it as a policy enforcement gateway that ensures every agent action is authorized, logged, and traceable.

### Three Pillars of Agent Governance

**1. Enforceable Policy**

Define what agents can and cannot do with declarative policies. Allow, deny, or require human approval for any action - all enforced at the gateway level.

**2. Identity and Least Privilege**

RBAC for the agent era. Assign identities to agents, define roles, and ensure agents only have access to the tools and data they need.

**3. Audit-Grade Evidence**

Every decision is logged with full context. Decision traces show exactly why an action was allowed or denied, giving your security team complete visibility.

## Getting Started

Axite integrates with your existing agent infrastructure through our MCP gateway. Deploy in minutes, not months.
