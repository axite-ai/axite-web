This guide walks you through deploying your first Axite policy in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- An Axite account (request access at [axite.ai](/contact/sales))
- An existing AI agent or MCP-compatible tool
- Basic familiarity with JSON or TypeScript

## Step 1: Connect Your Agent

First, point your agent to the Axite gateway. If you are using MCP tools, update your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axite-gateway": {
      "url": "https://gateway.axite.ai",
      "apiKey": "your-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Define Your First Policy

Create a simple policy that requires approval for any external API calls:

```typescript
// policies/external-api-approval.ts
export const externalApiPolicy = {
  name: 'external-api-approval',
  description: 'Require approval for external API calls',
  rules: [
    {
      action: 'require_approval',
      conditions: [
        { field: 'tool.type', equals: 'http_request' },
        { field: 'request.url', notStartsWith: 'https://internal.' }
      ],
      approvers: ['security-team']
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Deploy the Policy

Use the Axite CLI to deploy:

```bash
axite policy deploy policies/external-api-approval.ts
```

Or deploy via the dashboard UI.

## Step 4: Test the Policy

Have your agent attempt an external API call. You should see:

1. The request appear in the Axite dashboard
2. An approval request sent to the security-team channel
3. The agent waiting for approval before proceeding

## Step 5: Review the Audit Log

Navigate to the Audit section in your dashboard. You will see:

- The original request
- The policy that matched
- The decision (require_approval)
- The approval status and approver

<Admonition type="note">
  All audit logs are retained for 90 days by default. Enterprise plans include custom retention periods.
</Admonition>
