As AI agents become more prevalent in enterprise environments, compliance teams are asking hard questions. How do you prove an agent followed the rules? How do you demonstrate due diligence? How do you audit autonomous systems?

## The Regulatory Landscape

Regulators are catching up to AI. Recent guidance from the SEC, OCC, and EU AI Act all emphasize:

- **Accountability** - Someone must be responsible for agent actions
- **Transparency** - Organizations must be able to explain decisions
- **Control** - There must be mechanisms to limit agent behavior
- **Evidence** - Actions must be logged and auditable

## Axite and Compliance

Axite was built with compliance in mind. Every feature maps to regulatory requirements:

| Requirement | Axite Capability |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Accountability | Agent identity with human ownership |
| Transparency | Decision traces for every action |
| Control | Policy enforcement at gateway |
| Evidence | Audit logs with 90-day retention |

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### Financial Services

Banks and financial institutions face strict oversight:

- **SEC Rule 17a-4** - Record retention requirements
- **OCC Guidelines** - Model risk management for AI
- **FINRA** - Supervision of automated systems

Axite helps by providing immutable audit logs and policy enforcement that can demonstrate regulatory compliance.

### Healthcare

HIPAA compliance requires:

- Access controls for PHI
- Audit trails for all data access
- Minimum necessary standard enforcement

Axite's identity and RBAC system ensures agents only access the patient data they need, with every access logged.

### Technology

Even without specific regulation, technology companies face:

- Customer data protection expectations
- SOC 2 compliance requirements
- GDPR for EU customers

## Building a Compliance Program

Organizations deploying agents with Axite typically follow this framework:

1. **Inventory** - Catalog all agents and their purposes
2. **Classify** - Assign risk levels to each agent
3. **Policy** - Define policies based on risk and regulatory requirements
4. **Monitor** - Review audit logs regularly
5. **Report** - Generate compliance reports for auditors

## The Future of Agent Compliance

As AI agents take on more critical tasks, we expect regulatory requirements to increase. Organizations that build compliance into their agent infrastructure now will be better positioned for whatever comes next.

Axite is committed to staying ahead of regulatory developments and providing the tools organizations need to deploy agents responsibly.
