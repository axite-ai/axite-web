Policies are the foundation of agent governance. Without clear rules about what agents can and cannot do, organizations face unpredictable behavior and compliance risks.

## The Policy Problem

Traditional access control was designed for humans. Users authenticate, receive permissions, and make decisions within those boundaries. Agents operate differently - they make thousands of decisions autonomously, often in milliseconds.

This scale requires a new approach: declarative policies enforced at the gateway.

## Axite Policy Architecture

Axite policies follow a simple model:

```typescript
interface Policy {
  name: string
  description: string
  rules: Rule[]
  priority: number
}

interface Rule {
  action: 'allow' | 'deny' | 'require_approval'
  conditions: Condition[]
  tools?: string[]
  resources?: string[]
}
```

### Policy Evaluation

When an agent requests an action, Axite evaluates all applicable policies:

1. **Match** - Find policies that apply to this agent and action
2. **Evaluate** - Check conditions against the current context
3. **Decide** - Return allow, deny, or require approval
4. **Log** - Record the decision with full context

### Example: Data Access Policy

```typescript
const sensitiveDataPolicy = {
  name: 'sensitive-data-access',
  description: 'Restrict access to PII and financial data',
  rules: [
    {
      action: 'deny',
      conditions: [
        { field: 'data.classification', equals: 'pii' },
        { field: 'agent.role', notIn: ['compliance-agent', 'hr-agent'] }
      ]
    },
    {
      action: 'require_approval',
      conditions: [
        { field: 'data.classification', equals: 'financial' },
        { field: 'amount', greaterThan: 10000 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Real-Time Enforcement

Policies are evaluated in real-time at the MCP gateway. There is no batch processing, no eventual consistency - every action is checked before execution.

<Admonition type="tip">
  Start with permissive policies and tighten over time. Axite's audit logs show exactly what actions agents are taking, helping you refine policies based on real behavior.
