When you have dozens of agents running across your organization, the question "which agent did what?" becomes critical. Axite's identity system brings RBAC to the agent era.

## Why Agent Identity Matters

In traditional systems, every action traces back to a human user. With agents, this chain breaks. An agent might:

- Run under a service account with broad permissions
- Share credentials with other agents
- Have no clear ownership or accountability

Axite solves this with dedicated agent identities.

## The Axite Identity Model

Every agent in Axite has:

- **Identity** - A unique identifier and associated metadata
- **Roles** - Permissions defining what the agent can do
- **Scope** - Resources the agent can access

```typescript
interface AgentIdentity {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  owner: string  // Human accountable for this agent
  roles: Role[]
  scopes: Scope[]
  metadata: Record<string, any>
}
```

## Implementing Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege states that agents should have only the permissions they need. Axite makes this practical:

### 1. Start with Zero Permissions

New agents have no permissions by default. Everything is denied until explicitly allowed.

### 2. Assign Purpose-Specific Roles

Create roles that match agent responsibilities:

```typescript
const customerSupportRole = {
  name: 'customer-support-agent',
  permissions: [
    'read:customer-tickets',
    'write:ticket-responses',
    'read:knowledge-base'
  ],
  restrictions: [
    'deny:customer-pii',
    'deny:billing-data'
  ]
}
```

### 3. Scope to Specific Resources

Limit agents to specific data partitions:

```typescript
const agentScope = {
  agentId: 'support-agent-1',
  resources: [
    { type: 'tickets', filter: { region: 'north-america' } },
    { type: 'knowledge', filter: { category: 'product-faq' } }
  ]
}
```

## Role Hierarchy

Axite supports role inheritance for managing complex permission structures:

```
admin-agent
├── supervisor-agent (inherits + additional permissions)
│   └── worker-agent (inherits + restricted)
```

## Auditing Identity

Every action logged in Axite includes the agent identity, making it easy to:

- Track which agent took an action
- Identify permission issues
- Audit compliance requirements
