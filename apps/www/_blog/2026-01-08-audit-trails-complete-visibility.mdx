When something goes wrong with an AI agent, the first question is always "what happened?" Axite's audit system provides the answer with complete decision traces.

## The Visibility Problem

Most agent systems log outcomes but not reasoning. You know the agent sent an email, but not:

- Why it decided to send that email
- What policies were evaluated
- What data influenced the decision
- Who or what approved the action

This gap makes debugging difficult and compliance audits nearly impossible.

## Axite Audit Architecture

Every action that passes through Axite generates a comprehensive audit record:

```typescript
interface AuditRecord {
  id: string
  timestamp: string
  agent: AgentIdentity
  action: ActionRequest
  decision: 'allow' | 'deny' | 'require_approval'
  policies: PolicyEvaluation[]
  context: Record<string, any>
  trace: DecisionTrace
}
```

### Decision Traces

The decision trace shows exactly how Axite reached its conclusion:

```json
{
  "trace": {
    "policiesEvaluated": 3,
    "matchingPolicies": [
      {
        "name": "data-access-policy",
        "rules": [
          {
            "condition": "data.classification == 'internal'",
            "result": true
          },
          {
            "condition": "agent.role in ['analyst', 'admin']",
            "result": true
          }
        ],
        "decision": "allow"
      }
    ],
    "finalDecision": "allow",
    "decisionTime": "2.3ms"
  }
}
```

## Querying Audit Logs

Axite provides powerful query capabilities:

```typescript
// Find all denied actions in the last 24 hours
const deniedActions = await axite.audit.query({
  decision: 'deny',
  timeRange: { last: '24h' }
})

// Find all actions by a specific agent
const agentActions = await axite.audit.query({
  agentId: 'data-processor-1',
  timeRange: { from: '2026-01-01', to: '2026-01-08' }
})

// Find all actions touching sensitive data
const sensitiveAccess = await axite.audit.query({
  'context.data.classification': 'pii'
})
```

## Compliance Reports

Generate audit reports for compliance reviews:

- **SOC 2** - Access logs, policy enforcement records
- **HIPAA** - PHI access tracking, approval workflows
- **GDPR** - Data access logs, consent verification

<Admonition type="tip">
  Schedule automated compliance reports to run weekly. They are delivered to your security team's inbox every Monday.

## Retention and Export

Audit logs are retained for 90 days by default. Enterprise plans support:

- Custom retention periods (up to 7 years)
- Export to your SIEM or data warehouse
- Real-time streaming to external systems

## Getting Started

1. Audit logging is enabled by default for all Axite accounts
2. Access the Audit dashboard to view recent activity
3. Set up [alerts](/docs/audit/alerts) for specific conditions
4. Configure [exports](/docs/audit/export) for long-term storage
