### SOC 2 Type II

Axite is actively working toward SOC 2 Type II certification. We've implemented the controls and are in the audit process.

**Status:** In Progress

We prioritize security controls that matter for agent governance: access control, audit logging, and data protection.

</Section>

<Section icon={<Lock strokeWidth={1}/>}>

### Data Encryption

All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 and in transit via TLS 1.3.

Agent requests, policy decisions, and audit logs are encrypted before storage. Encryption keys are managed through industry-standard key management practices.

</Section>

<Section icon={<Eye strokeWidth={1}/>}>

### Audit Logging

Every agent action, policy decision, and administrative change is logged with full context.

Audit logs are:
- Immutable (append-only)
- Encrypted at rest
- Retained per your plan tier
- Exportable for compliance

</Section>

<Section icon={<KeyIcon strokeWidth={1}/>}>

### Secrets Management

Secrets (API keys, tokens) are never logged in audit trails or decision traces.

We use secure secret storage with automatic rotation support. Secrets in transit are always encrypted and never exposed in logs.

</Section>

<Section icon={<UserGroupIcon strokeWidth={1}/>}>

### Access Control

Axite enforces role-based access control (RBAC) for both users and agents.

Administrative access requires authentication. Agent identities are verified before policy evaluation. Least-privilege is the default.

</Section>

<Section icon={<ServerIcon strokeWidth={1}/>}>

### Infrastructure Security

Axite's managed cloud runs on hardened infrastructure with:

- Network isolation and firewalls
- Regular security patching
- Intrusion detection monitoring
- DDoS protection

</Section>

<Section icon={<ClipboardCheckIcon strokeWidth={1}/>}>

### Vulnerability Management

We conduct regular security assessments including:

- Automated dependency scanning
- Static code analysis
- Penetration testing (annual)
- Responsible disclosure program

Report security issues to security@axite.ai

</Section>

<Section icon={<FileText strokeWidth={1}/>}>

### Data Handling

**What we store:**
- Agent requests (configurable retention)
- Policy decisions and traces
- Administrative audit logs

**What we don't store:**
- Secrets or credentials
- Unnecessary PII
- Raw tool responses (optional)

</Section>

<Section icon={<Activity strokeWidth={1}/>}>

### HIPAA

HIPAA compliance is on our roadmap. We are evaluating the controls needed to handle Protected Health Information (PHI).

**Status:** On Roadmap

Enterprise and Team customers will be able to request a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) once HIPAA compliance is achieved.

</Section>
