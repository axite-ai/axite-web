You are working in /data/axite-web on the demo-walkthrough-v4 branch. Execute the implementation plan at /data/axite-web/docs/plans/2026-02-16-demo-walkthrough-v2.md. Also read the design spec at /data/axite-web/docs/plans/2026-02-16-demo-walkthrough-design.md and the frontend-design skill at /data/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md.

Use subagent-driven-development to execute: dispatch fresh sub-agents per task with two-stage review (spec compliance then code quality). Tasks 1-4 are independent, task 5 depends on 1-4, task 6 depends on 5.

When completely finished, run: openclaw system event --text "Done: Demo walkthrough v4 complete on demo-walkthrough-v4 branch" --mode now
