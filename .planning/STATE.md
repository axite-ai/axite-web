Recent v1.1 decisions:
- Defer logo replacement to future milestone (user providing assets separately)
- Keep Supabase blog content unchanged (SEO considerations)
- Brand voice: calm, precise, mechanism-first, evidence-first
- Inter font chosen as primary geometric sans-serif (open source, UI-optimized)
- Font-weight 600 (semibold) for headings - confident but not heavy
- Selection color #93b4ff (light navy) for brand consistency
- Navy-to-teal gradient for hero text (maintains visual interest)
- Consistent navy (#3B63F3) for all SVG fills
