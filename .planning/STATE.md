## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Full v1.0 decisions archived in .planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md

Recent v1.1 decisions:
- Defer logo replacement to future milestone (user providing assets separately)
- Keep Supabase blog content unchanged (SEO considerations)
- Brand voice: calm, precise, mechanism-first, evidence-first

### Brand Identity

**Product:** Agent Governance Platform - control plane for agent actions
**Voice:** Calm, precise, mechanism-first, evidence-first
**Messaging pillars:**
1. Enforceable Policy - allow/deny/approve at the gateway
2. Identity + Least Privilege - RBAC for agents, tools, and actions
3. Audit-Grade Evidence - logs + decision traces

**Colors:**
- Primary Navy: #3B63F3
- Accent Teal: #00B3A4

### Pending Todos

None - milestone starting fresh.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Logo and brand assets needed from user before visual rebrand phase
- Supabase branding deeply embedded in code - will need thorough audit
