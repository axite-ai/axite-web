## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent v1.1 decisions (still relevant):
- Defer logo replacement to future milestone
- Brand voice: calm, precise, mechanism-first, evidence-first
- Navy (#3B63F3) primary, Teal (#00B3A4) accent
- Inter font, semibold (600) headings

v1.2 design constraint:
- For each section, search existing Supabase components first
- Evaluate and select best existing design to adapt
- No creative generation of new layouts/visuals

### Brand Identity

**Product:** Agent Governance Platform - control plane for agent actions
**Voice:** Calm, precise, mechanism-first, evidence-first
**Messaging pillars:**
1. Enforceable Policy - allow/deny/approve at the gateway
2. Identity + Least Privilege - RBAC for agents, tools, and actions
3. Audit-Grade Evidence - logs + decision traces

### Pending Todos

None

### Blockers/Concerns

- Logo and brand assets needed from user before visual rebrand phase
- FAQs section still shows Supabase content (will be removed in cleanup)
