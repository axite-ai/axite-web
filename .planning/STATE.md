# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-23)

**Core value:** Get a professional, working marketing website deployed to axite.ai using battle-tested code instead of AI-generated slop.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Axite Rebrand — visual + content rebrand + deploy

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Full v1.0 decisions archived in .planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md

### Brand Identity

**Product:** Agent Governance Platform — control plane for agent actions
**Voice:** Calm, precise, mechanism-first, evidence-first
**Messaging pillars:**
1. Enforceable Policy — allow/deny/approve at the gateway
2. Identity + Least Privilege — RBAC for agents, tools, and actions
3. Audit-Grade Evidence — logs + decision traces

**Assets:** Logo/colors to be provided by user (not included in scope)

### Pending Todos

None — milestone starting fresh.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Logo and brand assets needed from user before visual rebrand phase
- Supabase branding deeply embedded in code — will need thorough audit
