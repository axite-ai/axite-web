<objective>
Build the ProofSection component that demonstrates Axite's policy enforcement capability through a visual demo and establishes trust with SOC2 indicator.

Purpose: Show product capability visually (Allowed vs Blocked) and build credibility with compliance indicators.
Output: Three component files ready for homepage integration.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create PolicyDemo component</name>
  <files>apps/www/components/ProofSection/PolicyDemo.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a STATIC side-by-side demo showing Allowed vs Blocked policy decisions.

Structure:
1. Two-column grid layout (stacked on mobile, side-by-side on md+)
2. Each column uses Panel component for window-frame aesthetic
3. Each panel shows a decision with trace details

Left panel (Allowed):
- Title: "Allowed Action"
- Timestamp: "2024-01-24 09:15:32 UTC"
- Action: "Read customer profile for support ticket #4521"
- Result: Badge variant="success" with text "Allowed"
- Trace details:
  - Policy: "sales-team-read-only"
  - Rule: "allow-customer-read"
  - Identity: "agent:support-bot"

Right panel (Blocked):
- Title: "Blocked Action"
- Timestamp: "2024-01-24 09:15:47 UTC"
- Action: "Access SSN field in customer record"
- Result: Badge variant="destructive" with text "Blocked"
- Trace details:
  - Policy: "pii-protection"
  - Rule: "deny-sensitive-fields"
  - Identity: "agent:support-bot"
  - Reason: "Action outside permitted scope"

Imports:
- Panel from '~/components/Panel'
- Badge from 'ui'
- cn from 'ui'

CRITICAL: This is a STATIC component. No useState, no useEffect, no animation, no framer-motion imports. Hardcode all data directly in JSX.

Styling:
- Use font-mono text-xs for timestamps and trace details
- Use text-foreground-lighter for secondary text
- Panel headers should have border-b border-border
- Add window dots (three small circles) in panel headers for product screenshot aesthetic
  </action>
  <verify>File exists with Panel import, Badge import, no useState/useEffect/motion imports</verify>
  <done>PolicyDemo.tsx renders static side-by-side comparison with Allowed (green badge) and Blocked (red badge) scenarios</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create TrustStrip component</name>
  <files>apps/www/components/ProofSection/TrustStrip.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a horizontal trust indicator row with SOC2 badge and Trust Center link.

Layout:
- Centered flex container with items-center justify-center gap-8
- Left side: SOC2 badge image + "SOC2 Type II In Progress" text
- Right side: "View Trust Center" link to /trust

SOC2 section:
- img src="/images/security/soc2-type2.svg" alt="SOC2 Type II" className="h-12 w-auto"
- Text: span with text-sm text-foreground-light

Trust Center link:
- Use Next.js Link component
- href="/trust"
- Styling: text-sm text-brand hover:text-brand-600 transition-colors underline-offset-4 hover:underline

Imports:
- Link from 'next/link'

Wrapper:
- py-8 for vertical spacing
- border-t border-border to separate from demo above
  </action>
  <verify>File exists with Link import, /images/security/soc2-type2.svg image reference, /trust href</verify>
  <done>TrustStrip.tsx renders SOC2 badge with status text and functional Trust Center link</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create ProofSection index</name>
  <files>apps/www/components/ProofSection/index.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create the main ProofSection component that composes PolicyDemo and TrustStrip.

Structure:
1. SectionContainer wrapper for consistent spacing
2. SectionHeader with:
   - subtitle: "See it in action"
   - title: "Policy enforcement that explains itself"
3. PolicyDemo component (demo area)
4. TrustStrip component (trust indicators)

Imports:
- SectionContainer from '~/components/Layouts/SectionContainer'
- SectionHeader from '~/components/UI/SectionHeader'
- PolicyDemo from './PolicyDemo'
- TrustStrip from './TrustStrip'

Spacing:
- Add mt-8 or mt-12 between SectionHeader and PolicyDemo
- TrustStrip naturally follows with its own top border

Export:
- export default ProofSection
  </action>
  <verify>File exists with all 4 imports (SectionContainer, SectionHeader, PolicyDemo, TrustStrip) and default export</verify>
  <done>ProofSection/index.tsx exports complete section ready for homepage integration</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. All three files exist in apps/www/components/ProofSection/
2. No TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes (or only pre-existing errors)
3. PolicyDemo.tsx contains no useState, useEffect, or framer-motion imports
4. TrustStrip.tsx references /images/security/soc2-type2.svg and /trust
5. index.tsx imports and renders both PolicyDemo and TrustStrip
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- ProofSection component tree compiles without errors
- PolicyDemo shows two-column layout with Panel window frames
- TrustStrip shows SOC2 badge and Trust Center link
- Component is ready for homepage integration
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/14-proof-trust/14-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
