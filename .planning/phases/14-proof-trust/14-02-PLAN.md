<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add ProofSection to homepage</name>
  <files>apps/www/pages/index.tsx</files>
  <action>
Import and add ProofSection to the homepage layout.

Import (using dynamic import pattern like other components):
```tsx
const ProofSection = dynamic(() => import('~/components/ProofSection'))
```

Position in JSX:
- Place ProofSection immediately after Hero
- Before Logos (if present) or before other content sections

The render order should be:
1. Hero
2. ProofSection (NEW)
3. Logos (or whatever section currently follows Hero)
4. ... rest of existing sections

Do NOT remove any existing sections. Just add ProofSection in the right position.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `pnpm build` in apps/www - should complete without errors related to ProofSection</verify>
  <done>Homepage includes ProofSection after Hero, build succeeds</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify phase success criteria</name>
  <files>N/A - verification task</files>
  <action>
Verify all Phase 14 success criteria by running dev server and checking:

1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev` from apps/www directory
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

Success Criteria Verification:

SC1: "Demo component shows Allowed/Blocked decisions with decision trace"
- Two panels visible (Allowed on left, Blocked on right)
- Each panel has timestamp, action description, result badge, and policy trace
- Allowed badge is green (success variant)
- Blocked badge is red (destructive variant)

SC2: "SOC2 Type II status indicator visible (badge or text)"
- SOC2 Type II badge image is visible below the demo
- Text "SOC2 Type II In Progress" appears next to badge

SC3: "Link to Trust Center (/trust) present and functional"
- "View Trust Center" link is visible
- Clicking the link navigates to /trust page
- /trust page loads correctly

Run verification and document results.
  </action>
  <verify>
All three success criteria pass:
1. Demo shows Allowed/Blocked with traces
2. SOC2 indicator visible
3. Trust Center link works
  </verify>
  <done>Phase 14 success criteria verified - ProofSection renders correctly with all required elements</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `pnpm build` in apps/www completes without errors
2. `pnpm dev` starts successfully
3. Homepage at localhost:3000 shows ProofSection after Hero
4. Demo panels display Allowed (green) and Blocked (red) decisions with traces
5. SOC2 badge and "In Progress" text visible
6. /trust link navigates correctly
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 14 Success Criteria (from ROADMAP.md):
1. Demo component shows Allowed/Blocked decisions with decision trace - VERIFIED
2. SOC2 Type II status indicator visible (badge or text) - VERIFIED
3. Link to Trust Center (/trust) present and functional - VERIFIED
</success_criteria>
