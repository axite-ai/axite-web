Start dev server and verify all Phase 16 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:

1. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   cd apps/www && npm run dev
   ```

2. Check each success criterion:

   **Criterion 1: Three-step "How It Works" section visible (Connect, Define, Monitor)**
   - Navigate to localhost:3000
   - Scroll to HowItWorksSection
   - Verify three steps are visible with Connect, Define, Monitor content

   **Criterion 2: Primary CTA button appears after How It Works steps**
   - NOTE: Per CONTEXT.md, there is NO CTA after How It Works
   - This criterion from ROADMAP conflicts with user decision
   - Verify NO CTA after How It Works (user decision takes precedence)

   **Criterion 3: Security section with Trust Center link and data handling summary**
   - Scroll to SecuritySection
   - Verify security posture items are visible
   - Verify "View Trust Center" link/button exists
   - Click link and verify it goes to /trust
   - Verify data handling summary is present

   **Criterion 4: Final CTA section with outcome restatement and primary button**
   - Scroll to FinalCTASection (before footer)
   - Verify outcome headline is present
   - Verify "Book Security Review" button is visible
   - Verify button links to /contact/sales

   **Criterion 5: Minimal footer with Docs, Trust Center, Terms/Privacy, and contact email**
   - Scroll to footer
   - Verify links present: Docs, Trust Center, Terms, Privacy
   - Verify contact email (hello@axite.ai)
   - Verify NO Supabase social links
   - Verify minimal, clean design

3. Additional verifications:
   - No Supabase-specific sections (Products, HeroFrameworks, CustomerStories, etc.)
   - Page loads without console errors
   - All links function correctly

4. Run curl checks for route verification:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/trust  # Should return 200
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/terms  # Should return 200
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/privacy  # Should return 200
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/contact/sales  # Should return 200
   ```
  </action>
  <verify>
