<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create SecuritySection component</name>
  <files>apps/www/components/SecuritySection/index.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a SecuritySection component with full security posture coverage:

1. Section structure:
   - Use SectionContainer for wrapper
   - SectionHeader with appropriate title (e.g., "Security & Compliance")
   - subtitle: "Enterprise-ready"

2. Security posture items (grid of 4-6 items):
   - SOC 2 Type II (In Progress)
   - Data Encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit)
   - Access Controls (RBAC for users and agents)
   - Audit Logging (Immutable, encrypted, exportable)
   - Data Residency (US default, EU available)
   - Secrets Management (Never logged, always encrypted)

3. Each item should have:
   - Icon (use lucide-react icons like Shield, Lock, Key, Eye, Server, Globe)
   - Title
   - Brief description (1 sentence)

4. Prominent "View Trust Center" link:
   - Use Button component with Link to /trust
   - Can be primary or secondary style (Claude's discretion)
   - Place after the security items grid

5. Data handling summary (brief):
   - What we store: Agent requests, policy decisions, audit logs
   - What we don't store: Secrets, credentials, unnecessary PII
   - Can be inline text or small card

6. Layout:
   - Grid of security items: 2 cols on mobile, 3 or 4 cols on desktop
   - Trust Center button centered or left-aligned below
   - Clean, scannable format

Use icons from lucide-react (already used in trust.mdx and other components).
