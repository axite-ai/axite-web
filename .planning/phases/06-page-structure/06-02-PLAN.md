  <how-to-verify>
Start dev server if not already running:
```
cd apps/www && pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is in use) in browser.

**1. Desktop Navigation (on wide screen):**
- [ ] Supabase logo visible in top left
- [ ] Navigation items visible: Product, Developers, Solutions, Pricing, Docs, Blog
- [ ] Hover over "Product" — dropdown menu appears with product options
- [ ] Hover over "Developers" — dropdown menu appears
- [ ] Hover over "Solutions" — dropdown menu appears
- [ ] Click "Pricing" — navigates to /pricing page
- [ ] Click "Blog" — navigates to /blog page

**2. Mobile Navigation (resize browser to narrow width OR use dev tools mobile view):**
- [ ] Hamburger menu icon appears (three lines)
- [ ] Click hamburger — mobile menu slides in/opens
- [ ] Menu shows navigation items
- [ ] Click hamburger or outside to close — menu closes
- [ ] Body scroll is locked when menu is open

**3. Footer:**
- [ ] Footer visible at bottom of page (scroll down on homepage)
- [ ] Supabase logo in footer
- [ ] Link sections visible (Product, Resources, Company, etc.)
- [ ] Social media icons visible (Twitter/X, GitHub, Discord, YouTube)
- [ ] Security badges section visible (SOC2, HIPAA)
- [ ] Copyright text visible

**4. Theme Switching:**
- [ ] Theme toggle visible in footer (sun/moon icon or similar)
- [ ] Click toggle — page switches between light and dark themes
- [ ] Navigation background changes appropriately
- [ ] Footer background changes appropriately
- [ ] Navigate to /pricing — theme persists
- [ ] Navigate to /blog — theme persists
- [ ] Refresh page — theme persists (stored in localStorage or cookie)

**5. Page Layouts:**
- [ ] Homepage has hero section, logos, feature sections
- [ ] Pricing page has pricing cards/tiers displayed
- [ ] Pages don't have obvious layout breaks or missing content

Note: Some links may 404 (expected — we didn't extract all sub-pages). Focus on structural elements working, not all links being valid.
