# Phase 13: Header & Hero - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Landing page has minimal header and compelling outcome-first hero. Header shows Axite logo and single CTA. Hero communicates outcome, identifies audience, and provides clear CTAs.

## Implementation Decisions

### Header Design
- Keep existing Supabase header behavior (sticky/static, background treatment)
- Keep existing Supabase header layout pattern
- Match existing Supabase header CTA button styling

### Hero Headline & Copy
- Claude's discretion on exact headline wording (outcome-focused)
- Claude's discretion on subhead and target audience phrasing
- Follow established brand voice: calm, precise, mechanism-first

### Hero Visual Layout
- Keep existing Supabase hero text alignment pattern
- Keep existing Supabase hero visual element approach
- Keep existing Supabase hero background treatment
- Keep existing Supabase hero height

### CTA Buttons
- Primary CTA: "Book Security Review" links to Calendly/booking (placeholder URL for now)
- Secondary link: "View Docs" links to /docs path
- Keep existing Supabase hero CTA styling and arrangement pattern

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact headline and subhead copy (following brand voice)
- All visual styling details (match Supabase patterns)
- Specific spacing and typography decisions

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Design constraint: Search existing Supabase components first, adapt best existing design
- User wants to preserve Supabase's established patterns for header and hero
- Calendly link for booking CTA (placeholder href until actual link provided)
