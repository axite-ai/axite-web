<objective>
Verify development environment works end-to-end

Purpose: This is the final verification plan for Phase 4. After Plans 01 and 02 fix the known blockers, this plan verifies the phase success criteria are met: dev server starts, homepage loads, navigation works, hot reload functions.

Output: Verified working development environment

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Start dev server and verify it runs</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run the development server from apps/www directory:
```bash
cd apps/www && pnpm dev
```

Watch the terminal output for:
1. Server starting message (should see "Ready in X.Xs")
2. No fatal/blocking errors
3. Deprecation warnings and non-critical warnings are acceptable per CONTEXT.md

If there are fatal errors:
- CSS module errors: Check Plan 01 work
- Common import errors: Check Plan 02 work
- Other errors: Fix if simple, otherwise document for future phase

Keep the server running for subsequent verification tasks.
  </action>
  <verify>Dev server is running and shows "Ready" message without fatal errors</verify>
  <done>pnpm dev starts and reports ready without blocking errors</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Fix any remaining compilation errors on homepage</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
With dev server running, open http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown in terminal) in browser.

The page will trigger compilation. Watch terminal for compilation errors.

If there are errors:
1. Missing imports from 'common': Add stubs in lib/common/index.ts
2. Missing CSS classes: Check Tailwind content paths
3. Supabase SDK errors: Add mock/no-op (per CONTEXT.md)
4. Type errors: Use Claude's discretion - fix if simple, suppress if complex

Fix errors iteratively until homepage compiles and renders (even if not perfect).

Per CONTEXT.md: "No fatal/blocking errors. Deprecation warnings and non-critical errors are acceptable."
  </action>
  <verify>Homepage renders in browser without crashing (content quality doesn't matter)</verify>
  <done>Homepage compiles and renders in browser</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Development environment with dev server, homepage rendering, and configuration fixes from Plans 01-02</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Terminal should show dev server running without fatal errors
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Verify you see page content (layout may be imperfect, that's OK)
4. Try clicking a navigation link (pricing, about, etc.)
5. Edit a Tailwind class in any visible component and verify hot reload updates the browser

**Acceptable issues (per CONTEXT.md):**
- Deprecation warnings in terminal
- Some pages returning 404
- Missing images or assets
- Imperfect styling

**NOT acceptable:**
- Server crashes
- Browser console shows uncaught exceptions
- Pages that crash instead of rendering
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if dev environment works, or describe specific issues found</resume-signal>

Phase 4 Success Criteria (from ROADMAP.md):
1. pnpm dev starts without errors - verified by Task 1
2. Homepage loads in browser at localhost:3000 - verified by Task 2
3. Navigation between pages works without crashes - verified in checkpoint
4. Hot reload functions when editing components - verified in checkpoint
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Dev server starts and stays running
- Homepage renders in browser
- At least one navigation link works without crashing
- Editing a component triggers hot reload in browser
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-development-environment/04-03-SUMMARY.md`
