## Goal

Delete unused Pricing and Enterprise component directories, and remove the solutions pages that depend on them.

## Context

The Pricing components are only used by the pricing page (being deleted).

The Enterprise components have a type (`SecuritySectionProps`) that is imported by 6 solution data files:
- `data/solutions/startups.tsx`
- `data/solutions/developers.tsx`
- `data/solutions/hackathon.tsx`
- `data/solutions/innovation-teams.tsx`
- `data/solutions/agencies.tsx`
- `data/solutions/postgres-developers.tsx`

These solution pages are all Supabase-specific content that is not relevant to Axite and should be removed. This allows us to cleanly delete all Enterprise components.

The solutions directory contains 14 pages - all Supabase audience pages that will be removed.

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Delete the Pricing components directory:
```bash
rm -rf apps/www/components/Pricing/
```
This removes 14 component files:
- PricingFAQs.tsx
- CostControlAnimation.tsx
- PricingDiskSection.tsx
- PricingComparisonTable.tsx
- PricingComputeAnimation.tsx
- ComputePricingCalculator.tsx
- PricingAddOnTable.tsx
- ComputePricingTable.tsx
- PricingComputeSection.tsx
- PricingTableRow.tsx
- PricingAddons.tsx
- UpgradePlan.tsx
- PricingIcons.tsx
- PricingPlans.tsx
</task>

<task id="2">
Delete the Enterprise components directory:
```bash
rm -rf apps/www/components/Enterprise/
```
This removes 6 component files:
- UseCases.tsx
- Support.tsx
- EnterpriseLogos.tsx
- CTAForm.tsx
- Performance.tsx
- Security.tsx
</task>

<task id="3">
Delete all solution pages (they're Supabase-specific audience pages):
```bash
rm -rf apps/www/pages/solutions/
```
This removes 14 solution pages:
- ai-builders.tsx
- agencies.tsx
- beginners.tsx
- developers.tsx
- enterprise.tsx (already handled but directory delete catches it)
- hackathon.tsx
- innovation-teams.tsx
- no-code.tsx
- postgres-developers.tsx
- startups.tsx
- switch-from-convex.tsx
- switch-from-firebase.tsx
- switch-from-neon.tsx
- vibe-coders.tsx
</task>

<task id="4">
Delete the solutions data directory:
```bash
rm -rf apps/www/data/solutions/
```
This removes all solution data files that imported Enterprise types.
</task>
