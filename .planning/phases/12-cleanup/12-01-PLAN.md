## Goal

Delete the main page files and their associated data files for /product, /pricing, and /enterprise routes.

## Context

Phase 12 requires removing pages that will be replaced by a single landing page. This plan removes the page files and their data dependencies.

Note: The solutions pages (startups, developers, etc.) that import from Enterprise/Security.tsx will be handled in a separate plan along with the component deletion.

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Delete the product page and its data file:
- Delete `apps/www/pages/product.tsx`
- Delete `apps/www/data/product.tsx`
- Delete `apps/www/data/products/governance/agent-gateway-visual.tsx`
</task>

<task id="2">
Delete the pricing page and its data files:
- Delete `apps/www/pages/pricing.tsx`
- Delete `apps/www/data/PricingAddOnTable.json`
- Delete `apps/www/data/PricingFAQ.json`
</task>

<task id="3">
Delete the enterprise page and its data file:
- Delete `apps/www/pages/solutions/enterprise.tsx`
- Delete `apps/www/data/enterprise.tsx`
</task>

## Verification

```bash
