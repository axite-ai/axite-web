## Goal

Update navigation to remove links to deleted pages and simplify the header for the new landing page.

## Context

With /product, /pricing, /enterprise, and /blog removed, the navigation needs to be updated:

Current navigation structure (nav.tsx):
```tsx
primaryNav: [
  { title: 'Product', hasDropdown: true, dropdown: <ProductDropdown /> },
  { title: 'Pricing', url: '/pricing' },
  { title: 'Enterprise', url: '/enterprise' },
  { title: 'Blog', url: '/blog' },
  { title: 'Trust', url: '/trust' },
]
```

For the new landing page (LP-01, LP-02), we want a minimal header with just logo and CTA. However, this phase is just cleanup - the header simplification happens in Phase 13.

For now, we need to remove the broken links but keep basic navigation working. We'll keep Trust and simplify the Product dropdown to just point to docs.

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Update `apps/www/data/nav.tsx` to remove Product dropdown, Pricing, Enterprise, and Blog links.

Replace the entire file with a minimal navigation:
```tsx
export const getMenu = () => ({
  primaryNav: [
    {
      title: 'Docs',
      url: '/docs',
    },
    {
      title: 'Trust',
      url: '/trust',
    },
  ],
})
```

This removes:
- Product dropdown import and usage
- Pricing link
- Enterprise link
- Blog link
</task>

<task id="2">
Delete the ProductDropdown component since it's no longer used:
```bash
rm apps/www/components/Nav/ProductDropdown.tsx
```

Note: This file contains hardcoded links to /product, /blog, /enterprise that would be broken. Deleting it is the cleanest solution.
</task>

## Verification

<verification>
```bash
# Verify nav.tsx doesn't reference deleted pages
grep -E "(Pricing|Enterprise|Blog|ProductDropdown)" apps/www/data/nav.tsx && echo "FAIL: nav.tsx still references deleted pages" || echo "OK: nav.tsx cleaned"

# Verify ProductDropdown is deleted
ls apps/www/components/Nav/ProductDropdown.tsx 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL: ProductDropdown.tsx still exists" || echo "OK: ProductDropdown.tsx deleted"

# Verify nav.tsx still has Trust
grep "Trust" apps/www/data/nav.tsx && echo "OK: Trust link preserved" || echo "FAIL: Trust link missing"
```
