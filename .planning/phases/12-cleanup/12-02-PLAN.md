## Goal

Delete the entire blog system including App Router pages, MDX posts, and API routes.

## Context

The blog is being removed as part of the landing page refactor. The site will focus on a single conversion-optimized landing page without blog content.

The blog consists of:
- App Router directory: `apps/www/app/blog/` (8 files)
- Blog posts: `apps/www/_blog/` (10 MDX files)
- API route: `apps/www/app/api-v2/blog-posts/route.ts`

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Delete the blog App Router directory:
```bash
rm -rf apps/www/app/blog/
```
This removes:
- `app/blog/page.tsx`
- `app/blog/BlogClient.tsx`
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
- `app/blog/[slug]/BlogPostClient.tsx`
- `app/blog/tags/[tag]/page.tsx`
- `app/blog/categories/[category]/page.tsx`
- `app/blog/authors/[author]/page.tsx`
- `app/blog/authors/[author]/AuthorClient.tsx`
</task>

<task id="2">
Delete all blog post MDX files:
```bash
rm -rf apps/www/_blog/
```
This removes 10 blog post MDX files.
</task>

<task id="3">
Delete the blog API route:
```bash
rm apps/www/app/api-v2/blog-posts/route.ts
```
</task>

ls -d apps/www/_blog 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL: _blog still exists" || echo "OK: _blog deleted"
