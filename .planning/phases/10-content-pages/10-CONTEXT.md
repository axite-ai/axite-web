# Phase 10: Content Pages - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Transform all marketing content pages to display Axite messaging around the three pillars: enforceable policy, identity & least privilege, and audit-grade evidence. Keep Supabase layout structure, update content only.

## Implementation Decisions

### Homepage Hero & Structure
- Headline: "Ship agents your security team can approve" (outcome-first)
- Subheadline structure (keep Supabase pattern):
  - "Axite is the agent governance control plane."
  - "Start your deployment with an MCP gateway, centralized policy (allow/deny/approve), RBAC, approvals, and audit-grade logs with decision traces."
- Primary CTA: "Try the sandbox" (product-forward)
- Secondary CTA: "Book a security review" (enterprise-forward)
- Visual: Keep Supabase hero visual pattern, update content only

### Feature Presentation
- Layout: Keep Supabase feature section structure
- Three pillars (policy, identity, audit) use existing layout
- Proof points: Claude's discretion on depth based on layout
- Flow diagram: Claude's discretion based on what layout supports
- Pillar terminology: Claude's discretion based on voice/tone

### Enterprise & Trust Pages
- Page structure: Keep Supabase structure for how these pages are organized
- Deployment options (three tiers):
  - Managed Cloud (Available now)
  - Private Deployment (Available by request)
  - Customer-Managed (Planned) — "If this is a requirement, we're recruiting design partners"
- Compliance: Roadmap approach — honest about what's in progress (e.g., "SOC 2 in progress")
- Enterprise CTA: "Book a security review"

### Pricing Page
- Model: Sandbox + Enterprise (two tiers)
- Sandbox: Feature-based framing — "All features, rate-limited"
- Enterprise: Focus on support level + deployment options
- CTAs: "Try sandbox" / "Book security review"

### Claude's Discretion
- Proof point depth for each pillar
- Flow diagram inclusion and placement
- Pillar terminology choice (Policy/Identity/Audit vs more descriptive)
- Specific layout decisions within Supabase structure
