  <name>Task 2: Update enterprise page meta and routing</name>
  <files>apps/www/pages/solutions/enterprise.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the enterprise page to reference Axite URLs:

Find and replace the following in the existing file:

1. Update the NextSeo openGraph URL (around line 28):
Change: `url: \`https://supabase.com/enterprise\``
To: `url: \`https://axite.ai/enterprise\``

2. Keep the rest of the component structure as-is, since it uses the content from data/enterprise.tsx

The component already dynamically loads content from the data file, so updating the data file handles most changes.

Only update the URL reference to axite.ai.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep "axite.ai" apps/www/pages/solutions/enterprise.tsx`
Verify: URL updated to Axite domain
Run: `grep "supabase.com" apps/www/pages/solutions/enterprise.tsx`
