# Removed Pages - Phase 9

**Created:** 2026-01-23
**Purpose:** Track Supabase pages removed from navigation (files kept in repo for reference)

## Strategy

Per Phase 9 context decisions:
- Old Supabase product URLs return hard 404
- Page files kept in repo for reference
- Only navigation links removed, not page files

## Blog Content

Blog content is **preserved** per project requirements:
- Blog index (/blog) remains linked
- Individual blog posts remain accessible
- Supabase blog content unchanged for SEO

## Future Cleanup

Consider for future milestones:
- Delete unused page files (after confirming no SEO impact)
- Set up redirects for high-traffic Supabase URLs
- Create Axite-specific content for key pages
