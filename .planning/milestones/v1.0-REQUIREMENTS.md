## v1 Requirements

### Extraction

- [x] **EXTRACT-01**: Clone Supabase repo and extract /apps/www code
- [x] **EXTRACT-02**: Resolve workspace:* and catalog: dependency protocols to explicit versions
- [x] **EXTRACT-03**: Inline required packages (ui, config, shared-data, icons, tsconfig)
- [x] **EXTRACT-04**: Get local development server running (pnpm dev works)

### Infrastructure

- [x] **INFRA-01**: Configure standalone Next.js 15.5.9 project (next.config.mjs, tsconfig.json)
- [x] **INFRA-02**: Set up Tailwind 3.4.x with inlined config (not v4)
- [x] **INFRA-03**: Fix all TypeScript path aliases (@ui/*, @common/*, etc.)
- [x] **INFRA-04**: Production build succeeds (pnpm build works)

### Content

- [x] **CONTENT-01**: Blog/MDX infrastructure working (may require Contentlayer migration)
- [x] **CONTENT-02**: Basic page layouts functional (homepage, about, pricing, etc.)
- [x] **CONTENT-03**: Navigation and footer working

---

## v2 (Deferred to Future Milestone)

- Deploy to axite.ai domain
- Swap logo and apply minimal Axite branding (BRAND-01, moved from v1)
- Remove LaunchWeek system entirely
- Remove Supabase analytics/tracking (PostHog, etc.)
- Audit and remove unused ui-patterns components
- Strip Supabase-specific integrations from common package

---

## Out of Scope

- **Full content replacement** — future milestone after site is running
- **Theme/color customization** — future milestone
- **New features** — not adding anything Supabase doesn't have
- **Upstream compatibility** — flattening means no easy upstream pulls
