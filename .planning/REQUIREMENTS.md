# Requirements: Axite Marketing Website

**Defined:** 2026-01-24
**Core Value:** Get a professional, working marketing website deployed to axite.ai using battle-tested code instead of AI-generated slop.

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for Landing Page Refactor milestone. Single focused landing page following YC-style conversion patterns.

**Design Constraint:** For each section, search existing Supabase components, layouts, SVGs, and page sections. Evaluate and select the best existing design to adapt. No creative generation of new layouts/visuals.

### Header

- [ ] **LP-01**: Minimal header with logo only (no navigation links)
- [ ] **LP-02**: Single primary CTA button ("Book Security Review") in header

### Hero

- [ ] **LP-03**: Outcome-first headline (not feature-first)
- [ ] **LP-04**: One-line subhead (who it's for + what it does)
- [ ] **LP-05**: Primary CTA "Book Security Review" (placeholder booking link)
- [ ] **LP-06**: Secondary "View Docs" link (visually lighter)

### Proof Demo

- [ ] **LP-07**: Reuse existing Supabase demo component (e.g., logs panel, ETLVisual) showing Allowed/Blocked + decision trace

### Trust Strip

- [ ] **LP-08**: SOC2 Type II status badge/indicator
- [ ] **LP-09**: Link to Trust Center (/trust)

### Problem to Transformation

- [ ] **LP-10**: 2-3 blocks mapping "current pain" → "what changes with Axite"

### Three Pillars

- [ ] **LP-11**: Enforceable Policy pillar with existing visual/component
- [ ] **LP-12**: Identity/Least Privilege pillar with existing visual/component
- [ ] **LP-13**: Audit Evidence pillar with existing visual/component (e.g., logs panel)

### How It Works

- [ ] **LP-14**: Step 1: Connect tools/MCP servers
- [ ] **LP-15**: Step 2: Define policies/identities
- [ ] **LP-16**: Step 3: Monitor/audit
- [ ] **LP-17**: Primary CTA repeated below steps

### Security Detail

- [ ] **LP-18**: Link to Trust Center
- [ ] **LP-19**: Data handling summary
- [ ] **LP-20**: Skimmable security info block

### Final CTA

- [ ] **LP-21**: One sentence restating outcome + primary CTA

### Footer

- [ ] **LP-22**: Minimal footer (Docs link, Trust Center, Terms/Privacy, contact email)

### Cleanup

- [ ] **CLEAN-06**: Remove /product page
- [ ] **CLEAN-07**: Remove /enterprise page
- [ ] **CLEAN-08**: Remove /pricing page
- [ ] **CLEAN-09**: Remove /blog and all blog posts
- [ ] **CLEAN-10**: Remove unused v1.1 components

### Keep

- [ ] **KEEP-01**: /trust page remains functional
- [ ] **KEEP-02**: Legal pages remain (terms, privacy)

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future milestones.

### Logo & Brand Assets

- **LOGO-01**: Axite logo in header, footer, favicon
- **LOGO-02**: OG images updated with Axite branding

### Documentation

- **DOCS-01**: External documentation site
- **DOCS-02**: API reference

### Interactive Features

- **DEMO-01**: Live sandbox/playground
- **DEMO-02**: Interactive product demo
